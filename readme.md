### height
The height of the video.

    [videojs height="264"]

### preload
Start loading the video as soon as possible, before the user clicks play.
Use 'auto', 'metadata', or 'none'. Auto will preload when the browser or device allows it. Metadata will load only the meta data of the video.

    [videojs preload="auto"]

### autoplay

    [videojs autoplay="true"]

### loop
Causes the video to start over as soon as it ends. Use 'true' or 'false'.

    [videojs loop="true"]

### controls
Use 'false' to hide the player controls.

    [videojs controls="false"]

### muted
Use 'true' to initially mute video.

    [videojs muted="true"]
        
### id
Add a custom ID to your video player.

    [videojs id="movie-id"]
    
### class
Add a custom class to your player. Use full for floating the video player using 'alignleft' or 'alignright'.

    [videojs class="alignright"]

### Tracks
Text Tracks are a function of HTML5 video for providing time triggered text to the viewer. To use tracks use the [track] shortcode inside of the [video] shortcode. You can set values for the kind, src, srclang, label, and default attributes. More information is available in the [Video.js Documentation](http://videojs.com/docs/tracks/).

    [videojs][track kind="captions" src="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-captions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" default="true"][/videojs]

### All Attributes Example

    [videojs mp4="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.mp4" ogg="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.ogg" webm="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.webm" poster="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.png" preload="auto" autoplay="true" width="640" height="264" id="movie-id" class="alignleft" controls="false" muted="true"][track kind="captions" src="http://example.com/path/to/captions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English" default="true"][/videojs]
    
### Video Resolution Selector
Allows you to use multiple video resolution sources, currently for mp4's only tho should work for anything. The first res will be the default. Make sure each mp4# matches res#

    [videojs mp41="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip360p.mp4" mp42="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip720p.mp4" mp43="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip1080p.mp4" res1="360" res2="720" res3="1080"]

##Video.js Settings Screen
--------------------------
The values set here will be the default values for all videos, unless you specify differently in the shortcode. Uncheck "Use CDN hosted version?" if you want to use a self-hosted copy of Video.js instead of the CDN hosted version. *Using the CDN hosted version is preferable in most situations.*

If you are using a responsive WordPress theme, you may want to check the *Responsive Video* checkbox.

Uncheck the *Use the [video] shortcode?* option __only__ if you are using WordPress 3.6+ and wish to use the [video] tag for MediaElement.js. You will still be able to use the [videojs] tag to embed videos using Video.js.
